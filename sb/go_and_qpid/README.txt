Demonstration of calling c code to read from a QPID queue

This demo requires QPID to be downloaded and installed.  See
https://qpid.apache.org/releases/qpid-cpp-1.39.0/index.html for details.

Once QPID is installed, just type make to build.

To run, need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to run the code,
e.g. setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib64/
